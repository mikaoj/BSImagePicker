A mix between the native iOS 8 gallery and facebooks image picker. It is intended as a replacement for UIImagePickerController for both selecting and taking photos.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.<br />
To use it in you own project
###### Swift
```swift
let vc = BSImagePickerViewController()

bs_presentImagePickerController(vc, animated: true,
    select: { (asset: PHAsset) -> Void in
      // User selected an asset.
      // Do something with it, start upload perhaps?
    }, deselect: { (asset: PHAsset) -> Void in
      // User deselected an assets.
      // Do something, cancel upload?
    }, cancel: { (assets: [PHAsset]) -> Void in
      // User cancelled. And this where the assets currently selected.
    }, finish: { (assets: [PHAsset]) -> Void in
      // User finished with these assets
}, completion: nil)
```
## Features
* Multiple selection.
* Fullscreen preview
* Switch albums.
* No localization needed (uses icons or system localizations).
* Take photos (it isn't enabled by default, so set takePhotos to true if you want it).
* Customizable - check out BSImagePickerSettings to see what you can tweak.

## Customization

You have access to the cancel, album and done button. Customize them as you would with any other UIBarButtonItem (cancel & finish) or UIButton (album).<br />
There are also a few other settings you can tweak. They are documented in BSImagePickerSettings.<br />
[Documentation @ cocoadocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/BSImagePicker/)

## Custom fetch results

Not happy with the fetch results (camera roll and albums) that BSImagePicker uses as default? Set the fetchResults property.
